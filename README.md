# 👋 Hi, I'm Gianfranco Damiani  

🎓 Data Analyst & Data Science Student @ Start2Impact University  
📍 Based in Bologna, Italy — planning to move to Madrid 🇪🇸  
💡 Passionate about data-driven insights, storytelling, and meaningful analysis.  

I focus on transforming complex datasets into clear, actionable stories — from data cleaning and feature engineering to predictive modeling and visualization.  
My tools of choice include **Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)**, **SQL**, and **Tableau**.
